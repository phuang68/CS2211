- Assignment 3
  - A C program named phone.c that takes as input (over standard input) a 10 digit phone number and a single character. The format of the phone number will be DDDDDDDDDD, that is, 10digits in a row with no spaces or other characters. The character will be a single uppercase or
    lowercase letter between A and D (e.g. A, b, c, D, d, etc).
  - A C program named dates.c that determines which of the entered dates comes later on the calendar. The user may enter any number of dates. The user will enter 0/0/0 to indicate that no more dates will be entered. Dates will be entered in the mm/dd/yy format where mm is a two digit month number (1 to 12), dd is a two digit day of the month (1 to 31) and yy is a two digit year (00 to 99). You should print an error if an invalid date is entered (does not follow the format or out of the given ranges) and ask the user for a new date (do not exit).
  - A C program named pi.c to approximate the mathematical
    constant pi. This program should contain a function named estimate pi with the following function prototype:  This function should take the value of N and return an estimation of pi using the technique
    described in this question.
  - A C program named change.c that determines the smallest number of $20, $10, $5, $2, and $1 bills/coins necessary to pay a dollar amount.
- Assignment 4
  - A simple cryptography library for the Caesar Cipher and
    Vigenere Cipher as well as a program to test these ciphers.
  - The program is divided into the following files:
    - ciphers.c: Will contain the code for the encryption and decryption functions for each cipher.
    - ciphers.h: A header le containing function prototypes for each function in ciphers.c.
    - cipher main.c: Contains your main function and code to test your cipher functions.
